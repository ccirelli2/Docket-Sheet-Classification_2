- Key Word Selection
- Missing docket sheet matches
- Performance of Decision Tree. 



1.) Frequency Distribution of Words - 'Appearance'

Selections:
- Appearance
- Bigrams

Coefficient of the Variance & STDV:
- If we simple sort in decending order using either of these values, we pick up bigrams that may only 
  show up 1% of the time in our text.  Therefore, we need to add to our delimiter another filter for
  bigrams that appear less than x % of the time for a given stage.  
- New Calculation:
	- Sort COVAR decending
	- Iterate the target stage column, [x for x in targetcol if x > 40%]


Changes being made to Ste2_P2_Module_Get_Top_Words

1.) Amending the delimiter for the limit_dataframe() funtion.  Adding a delimiter for Top15_highest_COCOEF and Top15_highest_STDV to limit the target column to values greater than 30%.
