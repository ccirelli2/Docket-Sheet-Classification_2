#### FUNCTIONS TO CALCULATE MEASUREMENTS OF CENTRAL TENDANCY


def get_Measurements_CentralTendancy(dataframe, measurement):
    '''
    Calculation_I:
        Input       = 'CalculationI_homebrew_STDV'
        Description = 
        AVG         = Average value for all rows (including zeros)
        STDV        = Is our Target_Freq minus our average * Target_Freq.  This will decrease our target by both the average 
                      and its own frequency such that we will be able to find those words that are most unique to our target
                      in terms of both their frequency and deviation from the mean. By not squaring our delta we also preserve 
                      the sign such that a Target_Freq that is less than the average will be negative and automatically fall to 
                      the bottom of our list. 
    Calculation_II:
        Input       = 'CalculationII_AVG_not_zero'
        Description = The purpose of this approach is to try to generate higher averages by focusing only on the non-zero
                      values.  This will ensure that a single value (other than our target) that has a very high freq does
                      not get overlooked by our model by dividing it by the total length of the row (10 in this case). 
        AVG         = Average of values not equal to zero. 
        STDV        = Using the Home_brew calculation from CalculationI. 
    
    Calculation_III:  
        Input       = 'CalculationIII_Correlation_Coefficient'
        Description = Calculate teh correlation coefficient as our target variable to identify key words. Note that this
                      approach will not yeild negative numbers, so we should only capture one list of values in descending
                      order with the highest COCEF values. 
        AVG         = Use the same calculation for CalculationII to generate the AVG of non-zero values. 
        STDV        = Lets use the traditional calculation for STDV
        COCEF       = STDV / AVG
